Things I'd like to do in order to make this a pro-level project

-4  add a table where every user question is normalized and accumulates a score. This will help rank the most asked questions 
    which will provide valuable information to employers regarding thier private doucumentation.

-3  add user authentication in order to tie their account to their previous conversations.

-5  update the UI so that instead of streamlit I use actual code to make the frontend better for users to use and look at.

-2  make code compatible with open source models.

-6  containerize with docker.

-7  CI/CD with kubernetes.
